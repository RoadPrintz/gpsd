.SH "NAME"
xgps \- X client for gpsd
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBxgps\fP [OPTIONS] [service[:port[:device]]]
.sp
\fBxgps\fP \-h
.sp
\fBxgps\fP \-V
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBxgps\fP is a simple sample client for gpsd with an X interface. It
displays current GNSS position/time/velocity information and (for
GNSS receivers that support the feature) the locations of accessible
satellites.
.sp
In the sky view, satellites are color\-coded to indicate quality of
signal, consult the data display to the left for exact figures in dB.
Diamond\-shaped icons indicate GLONASS satellites, squares are used for
SBAS (e.g. WAAS, EGNOS), circles indicate GPS, and down\-, up\-, right\-,
and left\-pointing triangles, respectively, indicate Galileo, BeiDou,
QZSS, and other systems\(aq satellites (e.g. IMES, IRNSS, as well as
unknown systems). Filled icons were used in the current fix, outline
icons were not. Hovering over a symbol with the mouse pointer will
temporarily display a small popup window with the satellite details from
the Satellite List pane.
.sp
\fBxgps\fP will run fine as a normal user, and fine as root.  Running \fBxgps\fP
under \fBsudo\fP will cause some loss of functionality.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-?\fP, \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Causes the client to emit a summary of its options and then exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-device DEVICE\fP
.RS 4
The device on the host to connect to. The default is empty (any).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-D LVL\fP, \fB\-\-debug LVL\fP
.RS 4
Sets the debug level, it is primarily for use by GPSD developers. It
enables various progress messages to standard error.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-host HOST\fP
.RS 4
The host (server) to connect to. The default is localhost.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l FMT\fP, \fB\-\-llfmt FMT\fP
.RS 4
Set the format of latitude and longitude reports. The value \(aqd\(aq
produces decimal degrees and is the default. The value \(aqm\(aq produces
degrees and decimal minutes. The value \(aqs\(aq produces degrees, minutes,
and decimal seconds.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p PORT\fP, \fB\-\-port PORT\fP
.RS 4
The port to connect to. The default is 2947.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r DEG\fP, \fB\-\-rotate DEG\fP
.RS 4
Accepts an argument in degrees, to rotate the skyview
counterclockwise.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
This option causes each client to dump the package version and exit.
.RE
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.sp
By default, clients collect data from the local \fBgpsd\fP daemon running
on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. The optional argument
to any client may override this behavior: \fB[server[:port[:device]]]\fP
.sp
For further explanation, and examples, see the \fBARGUMENTS\fP section in
the \fBgps\fP(1) man page
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
The \fBXGPSOPTS>\fP environment variable may be set to pass commonly used
command line options to \fBxgps\fP. This is often used to set the \fB\-u\fP
option for locale specific units. \fBXGPSOPTS\fP is processed before the CLI
options.
.sp
\fBxgps\fP also looks at other variables in the environment to figure out
the units for display \(em imperial, nautical, or metric. Here are the
variables and values checked:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
    GPSD_UNITS one of:
              i          = miles/feet
              imperial   = miles/feet
              n          = knots/feet
              nautical   = knots/feet
              m          = km/meters
              metric     = km/meters
    LC_MEASUREMENT
              en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters
    LANG
              en_US      = miles/feet
              C          = miles/feet
              POSIX      = miles/feet
              [other]    = km/meters
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
These preferences may be overridden by the \fB\-u\fP, or \fB\-\-units\fP option.
.sp
The \fB\-u\fP option can be used to set the system units for display;
follow the keyword with \(aqi\(aq for \(aqimperial\(aq for American units
(International Feet in altitude and error estimates, miles per hour in
speeds), \(aqn\(aq for \(aqnautical\(aq (feet in altitude and error estimates, knots
in speed) or \(aqm\(aq for \(aqmetric\(aq (meters in altitude and error estimates,
kilometers per hour in speeds).
.sp
Note: The USA Survey Foot is not supported.
.sp
The environment variable \fBGPSD_UNITS\fP is checked if no unit system is
specified on the command line or in \fBXPGSOPTS\fP it may be set to \(aqi\(aq.
\(aqimperial\(aq, \(aqm\(aq, \(aqmetric\(aq, or \(aqn\(aq, \(aqnautical\(aq.
.sp
\fBLC_MEASUREMENT\fP and then \fBLANG\fP are checked if no unit system has
been specified on the command line, in \fBXPGSOPTS\fP or in
\fBGPSD_UNITS\fP. If the value is \(aqC\(aq, \(aqPOSIX\(aq, or begins with \(aqen_US\(aq the
unit system is set to imperial. The default if no system has been
selected defaults to metric.
