.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBlcdgps\fP is a client that passes \fBgpsd\fP data to \fBlcdproc\fP, turning your
car computer into a very expensive and nearly feature\-free GPS receiver.
Currently assumes a 4x40 LCD and writes data formatted to fit that size
screen. Also displays 4\- or 6\-character Maidenhead grid square output.
.sp
\fBlcdgps\fP does not require root privileges. It will also run fine as root.
Running under sudo will cause loss of functionality.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.sp
By default, clients collect data from the local \fBgpsd\fP daemon running
on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. The optional argument
to any client may override this behavior: \fB[server[:port[:device]]]\fP
.sp
For further explanation, and examples, see the \fBARGUMENTS\fP section in
the \fBgps\fP(1) man page
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
The environment variable \fBGPSD_UNITS\fP is checked if no unit system is
specified on the command line. It may be set to \(aqi\(aq. \(aqimperial\(aq, \(aqm\(aq,
\(aqmetric\(aq, or \(aqn\(aq, \(aqnautical\(aq.
.sp
LC_MEASUREMENT and then LANG are checked if no unit system has
been specified on the command line, or in GPSD_UNITS. If the value
is \(aqC\(aq, \(aqPOSIX\(aq, or begins with \(aqen_US\(aq the unit system is set to
imperial. The default if no system has been selected defaults to metric.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
