.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program monitors the shared\-memory segments updated by gpsd 8 , and
possibly other refclock sources, as a way of communicating with \fBntpd\fP,
the Network Time Protocol daemon. It reads these in exactly the way an
\fBntpd\fP instance does. It can be run concurrently with \fBntpd\fP without
interfering with \fBntpd\fP\(cqs normal operation.
.sp
\fBntpshmmon\fP requires root privileges to access the root only NTP0 and
NTP1.  Running as a normal user will only allow access to NTP2 and NTP3.

.sp
This program runs forever, or until a termination option is matched, or
until interrupted, generating sample reports to standard output. Each
line consists of whitespace\-separated textual fields.

The output always begins with a header line expressing the version of
the output format; the version line begins with "ntpshmmon version" and
is followed by a numeric version field.
.sp
The remainder of the file is either comments or sample lines. A comment
line begins with a # and should be ignored by programs that interpret
this format.
.sp
The fields of a sample line are as follows:

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\

Source precision (log(2) of source jitter).

In these fields, "clock time" is the high\-precision system clock time
measured by the source and "receiver time" is from the receiver. Both
times are in UTC. It is normal for the seconds part of receiver time to
coincide with the seconds part of collection time and for the
nanoseconds part of receiver time to be zero.
.sp
If the \fB\-o\fP option is used, the "Seen@" column is replaced with the
"Offset" column. The "Offset" is the difference between "Clock" and
"Real" times.
