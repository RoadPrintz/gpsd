.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBzerk\fP is an all purpose GREIS (GNSS Receiver External Interface
Specification) fitting. If you do not have a Javad GPS that speaks
the GREIS protocol then you can stop reading now.
.sp
This tool operates with your Javad GPS at a very low level. To
understand \fBzerk\fP you must first be familiar with your Javad GPS and the
documentation for the GREIS protocol.
.URL "https://www.javad.com/downloads/javadgnss/manuals/GREIS/GREIS_Reference_Guide.pdf" "GREIS Guide" "."
.sp
\fBzerk\fP can decode common GREIS messages, poll the GPS status, enable and
disable GPS features, and send user\-generated commands to the GPS. It
can read GREIS messages from a file. It can read and write directly
through a serial device, or through a running \fBgpsd\fP instance.
.sp
\fBzerk\fP does not require root privileges, except maybe to access the
serial port in direct mode.  It will run fine as root.  Running under
sudo will cause loss of functionality.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
The program accepts the following options:
.sp
\fB\-?\fP, \fB\-h\fP
.RS 4
Makes \fBzerk\fP print a usage message and exit.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c COMMAND\fP

command string to send to the GPS. The string is sent verbatim, except
a newline is appended.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d OPTION\fP
.RS 4
Disable an option in the GPS. Accepts one parameter, OPTION, the
option to disable. \fBzerk\fP will exit after the GPS acknowledges the
command, unless the \fB\-W\fP is given.
.sp

Disable basic GREIS messages at 4Hz. The messages
are: [RT], [UO], [GT], [PV], [SG], [DP], [SI], [EL], [AZ], [EC], [SS], and [ET]

.RE
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e OPTION\fP
.RS 4
Enable an option in the GPS. Accepts one parameter, OPTION, the option
to enable. \fBzerk\fP will exit after the GPS acknowledges the command,
unless the \fB\-W\fP is given. \fB\-e\fP accepts the same OPTIONs as \fB\-d\fP, except the
action is to enable the option.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f FILE\fP
.RS 4
Connect to a file or device. Accepts one parameter, FILE, the file or
device to open. Files are opened read\-only. Character devices are
opened read/write, unless the \-r parameter is given. Requires the
pyserial module.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O OAF\fP
.RS 4
Load an Option Authorization File (OAF) into the GPS. Accepts one
parameter, OAF, command file to read. The OAF is just a special case
of a \(aq.jpo\(aq (GREIS command file). \-O will send any valid .jpo file to
the GPS.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p PRESET\fP
.RS 4
Send a preset command the GPS. Accepts one parameter, PRESET, the name
of the command to send. \fBzerk\fP will exit after the GPS acknowledges the
command, unless the \fB\-W\fP is given.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.sp
By default, clients collect data from the local \fBgpsd\fP daemon running
on localhost, using the default GPSD port 2947. The optional argument
to any client may override this behavior: \fB[server[:port[:device]]]\fP
.sp
For further explanation, and examples, see the \fBARGUMENTS\fP section in
the \fBgps\fP(1) man page
